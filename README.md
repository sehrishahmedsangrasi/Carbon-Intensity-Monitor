*Data Processing and API Fetching*
Overview

This project consists of two main files: one for data processing (data_processing.py) and another for fetching and processing data from an API (main.py). The purpose of this project is to provide a framework for retrieving data from an API, processing it, and saving the results for further analysis.
Files
1. data_processing.c

This file contains functions and utilities for processing data. It is designed to be modular and can be imported into other scripts for reuse.

2. main_code.c

This is the main script responsible for fetching data from an API, utilizing the functions from data_processing.py for processing, and saving the results.
Dependencies:

    requests: Used for making HTTP requests to the API.

Usage:

    Set up your API credentials or any required configuration variables at the beginning of the script.

    Adjust the API endpoint and parameters according to your needs.

    Use the functions from data_processing.c to process and save the data.

    Execute the script.
