# Shell Script Automation and Email Sending

## Overview

This branch includes a shell script (`automation.sh`) that automates specific tasks and sends an email using the SMTP server. The script can be scheduled to run periodically to automate routine processes and keep you informed about the execution status.

## Files

### 1. `automation.sh`

This shell script contains the automation logic and email sending functionality. It is designed to be easily configurable for different tasks and email settings.

#### Configuration:

- Set up the necessary variables at the beginning of the script, such as file paths, command parameters, and email settings.

- Update the `SMTP_SERVER`, `SMTP_PORT`, `EMAIL_USERNAME`, and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` variables with your SMTP server details.

- Customize the task-specific commands and operations within the script according to your requirements.

## Email Sending Functionality

The script utilizes the `send_email` function to send notifications. Ensure that your SMTP server details are correctly configured in the script`

## Schedule Automation

To schedule the script to run at specific intervals, you can use cron jobs. Open the crontab configuration by running:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add a line to schedule the script, for example, to run every day at 2 AM:

```bash
0 2 * * * /path/to/automation_script.sh
```
